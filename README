		               Issues
==========================================================================
my original program that i had made got way over complicated. I totaly
restarted the program and tried to incremently add things but started
running out of time and getting sloppy. Currently the program will not
kill the 100 process during run time, it will get up to 20...sometimes.
Luckily the alarm or interupt signal handling will keep you from having
to remove shared memory and msg q's. I could not for the life of me 
get the processes to switch queues with a circular doubly linked list.
I gave it my best shot on this one and will go ahead and take a loss.
